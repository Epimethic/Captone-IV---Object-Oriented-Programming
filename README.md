# Captone-IV---Object-Oriented-Programming
This capstone project focuses on using classes and methods via OOP. The program allows a stock manager to undertake stock taking of shoes. The user can view all items, restock items,  search for items and view specific items.

inventory.txt provides the product information in a txt file which the main program uses to read from.

inventory.py is the main program and it reads the data from inventory.txt and displays the data in a well structured way within the terminal.
